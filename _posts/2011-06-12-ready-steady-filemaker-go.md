Welcome to the fresher, newer, crisper MrWatson!

With the FileMaker Conference 2011 metaphorically and literally just around the corner, I'll soon be tanking fresh new ideas, and taking a fresh new look to the future.

I'm looking forward to sharing these ideas with you, and hope you'll join me here on life's never-ending leaning curve.

Yours, namely

MrW
