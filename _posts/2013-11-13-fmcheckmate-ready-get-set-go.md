Getting set up and started with fmCheckMate is now super-easy-peasy with new defaults, a new settings menu, and an improved XML Editor menu.

For a start fmCheckMate now starts up in Internal XML-Editor mode, so that newcomers can get to grips straight away with their fmxmlsnippets.

And with the new XML Editor Settings menu you get a great overview of your settings - and changing them is A SIMPLE SINGLE CLICK - with your mouse or with an easy-to-remember shortcut key.

Moreover, the XML Editor menu has been revamped:

Functions are much more logically grouped,

The new Clipboard menu shows all functions that interact with the clipboard,

The Find and Replace Menu has also been reorganised to make it even easier to find the functions and remember the keys.

One final snazzy touch: each tool file now has its correct icon in the Finder.

New Release of fmWorkMate (Mac) is available, as ever, on the Downloads page.

Happy Checking Mate! ;-)
