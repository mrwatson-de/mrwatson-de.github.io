Happy New Year fellow FileMaker developers!

With the new year comes a (slightly) new look to the website. Although teething troubles are to be expected, it should make getting updates out to you easier (and hopefully more frequent)...


Watch this space...

...there are some good things coming soon.

Next release of fmWorkMate to appear shortly

...including a brand new tool fmPluginMate

it makes managing your FileMaker plugins a drag.

:-)

Great greets

MrWatson
