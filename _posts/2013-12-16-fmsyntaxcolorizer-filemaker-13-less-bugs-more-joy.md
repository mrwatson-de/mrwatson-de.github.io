FileMaker 13 - the funky new version of our favorite FileMaker Pro database platform - has just been released with pepped up database creation, fantastic new layout styling, the FM WebDirect browser and a bunch of new script and function stuff.



To make FileMaker 13 as bright, colorful and awesome as FileMaker12 just...


download the new version of fmSyntaxColorizer from the Downloads page today.


With fmSyntaxColorizer 0.9v16 you can not only colorize the new fm13 script steps, but - thanks to the amazing MBS Plugin from Monkeybread Software - you can now also highlight undeclared $variables.


IT IS AWESOME! Those fiddly variable names that are always getting mistyped stick out like a sore thumb!


You can see the errors in an instant - EVEN IN THE SCRIPT DEBUGGER! No more stupid little errors!


Have a bright day!
