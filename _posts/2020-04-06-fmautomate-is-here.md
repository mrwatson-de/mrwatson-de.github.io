fmAutoMate

**Towards a FileMaker IDE**

Look out FileMaker Developers!

fmAutoMate is here and now!

A new tool from MrWatson to automate your Filemaker Script Workspace.

It's a Proof-of-Concept - showing that we CAN usefully turn FileMaker into an IDE (integrated Development Environment)

You are a few clicks away from a more productive day:

Download it from GitHub https://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmAutoMate !

Open fmAutoMate.fmp12

Press the [fmAutoMate] button

Open a Script in the Script Workspace

Right Click on a script step

Enjoy the power at your fingertips

It's open source, open to edit ... and open ended.

Let me know the great things you do with it / want to do with it.

Happy fmAutoMating!

MrWatson
